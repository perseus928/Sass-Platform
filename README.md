silverorange React Developer Assessment
=======================================

This exercise is designed to assess how you approach tasks required in your
position as a Reacgt developer at silverorange. We are interested to see how
you work as well, as what your final results are; include useful Git commit
messages and comments where you think your code may be unclear.

Tasks
-----
Using the provided `create-react-app` base in `/web`:

 1. Fetch post data from the provided Express API.
 2. Display a list of posts. Include the post title, summary, author, and
    publish date in the list.
 3. The list of posts should be displayed in reverse chronological order.
 4. Add buttons for each author. Make clicking on an author button filter
    the list of posts by author.
 5. Make the title of each post in the list clickable. When you click a post
    title, display the formatted post body and title.
 6. Implement basic snapshot regression tests tests using Jest for your
    components. Jest is installed by create-react-app and can be run from the
    `web/` folder with `yarn test`.

The post body is formatted as Markdown and the rendered page should use the
formatted Markdown.

Environment
-----------
You can use any stable version of Node JS.

Coding Standard
---------------
Please use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
for your code. The project is set up to lint your code using:
```sh
yarn lint
```

If your editor is not already configured to use Prettier, you can format code
in the project using:
```sh
yarn prettier-write
```

Dependencies
------------
Please use the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or
[NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) tools for dependency
management. You can use any 3rd-party libraries as necessary or as desired in
order to achieve the tasks. The project is currently set up to use Yarn but
you may update it to use NPM if that is your preference.

Commits
-------
Your commit history is important to us! Try to make meaningful commit messages
that show your progress.

Getting Started With the Express Backend (/api)
-----------------------------------------------
For this exercise a pre-built Express application is provided. The application
runs by default on `localhost:4000` and has the following endpoints:

 - `http://localhost:4000/posts` - returns a JSON-encoded array of blog posts.

### Running the Express Application

```sh
cd api/
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can verify the API is working by visiting http://localhost:4000/posts in
your browser or another HTTP client.

Getting Started with the React Frontend (/web)
----------------------------------------------
The React frontend is a bare create-react-app.

### Running the React Application

```sh
cd web/
yarn install
yarn start
```
